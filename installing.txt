2. Disk partitioning
If you have SSD you will heed 2 partitions on SSD:
1. EFI System Partition 32MB [vfat/FAT32]
2. Root [F2FS]
And 1 on HHD:
3. Home [EXT4]
All your kernels will be in ESP normal monolitic  kernels about 5Mb big, this partition can't be smaller than 32mb.
Root 60Gb more than enouth, so you can have dual-boot on 120Gb SSD.
