Official FAQ: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ
> What advantages of Gentoo GNU/Linux?
 - Flexibility and convinient package managment with Portage system.
 - In Gentoo you never pay for what you don't use
 - You can choose compiller gcc/clang/intel, standard C library musl/glibc/uclibc-ng, init system openrc/systemd you have no such choice in binary distros.
> How long it takes to compile package?
On Intel Core i3 4330 (2 cores 3.5GHz):
 - Linux Kernel - 3min 23sec
 - Chromium - 2h 52min
 - Firefox - 32min
 - Bash - 51sec
 - Weston - 32sec
> Is it true that Gentoo uses less ram?
Yes, especially if you use musl/uclibc and packages compiled with "-Os" option, but they will be slower, for fast binaries use glibc and -O2.
> How much faster Gentoo than other OS?
It can be 2-4 times faster than Windows, sometimes 1.4-2.3 times faster than Arch, sometimes slower, always faster than debian (ancient software and 
comiller)
> Can I compile packages on other PC?
Yes.
> What if I complete newfag without GNU/Linux expirience?
Read 'Linux Sea' book, lean to write dash scripts.
> I have some problems with Perl
perl-cleaner --reallyall
> I have gentoo-related problem

> How update system?
Normal update:
emerge -uDN @world
Deep uptate:
emerge -uDUN --changed-deps=y --with-bdeps=y @world
-av options is recommended (ask and verbose).
> How work and compile something big at the same time?
Specify MAKEOPTS='-jN' where N is number of cores -1.
> Can't compile package
1. Add bug to gentoo bugtracker.
2. Specify explicitly standard of the language in CFLAGS, -std=gnu++11 for example.
3. Try another compiler (clang)
4. Compile in one thread (MAKEOPTS='-j1'
> I have a question
Give maximum info, configs, logs.
> Where else I can find help?
Official IRC channel #gentoo (Freenode), #musl if you using gentoo musl.
